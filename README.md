## Types Of Programming :

<br>

### `1. Synchronous Programming`
### `2. Asynchronous Programming`

<br><br><br>

### 1. Synchronous Programming : 

<br>

> * Step by Step commands executed through code.
> * Doesn't allow skipping.
> * Can't change the order of statements while execution.
> * Request and Response will be executed in order.
> * We can't sent another request while we have not get the responce of previous request.
> * Doesn't support parallel tasks.
> * `In synchronous, it runs another request only after sending one request.`


<br><br>

### 2. Asynchronous Programming :

<br>

> * Orders can be changed.
> * We can execute more than one task together.
> * The Parallel Process is possible.
> * Another Request can be sent while previous request is yet pending.
> * `A request sent in asynchronous can be sent if it is in progress and another request is sent along with it. While it is not possible in Synchronous.`

<br>

### Asynchronous use two classes :

<br>

#### 1. Future class
#### 2. Stream class


<br><br>


## Future class :

<br> 

> `Future.delayed` => Duration() <br>
> `Timer.periodic` => Duration()
